/**
 * @brief Determines blocks to be evicted from the KV cache of a sequence based on the importance score calculated from the
 * attention scores of each token at each attention layer in the LLM.
 *
 * The KV cache is conceptually divided into three areas as shown below:
 *
 * ```
 * --> *logical KV cache space in blocks*
 * | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 * |<- start area->|<-   evictable area    ->|<- recent area ->|
 * ```
 *
 * The sizes of each areas are configurable. Once the sequence KV cache utilization is such that all three areas
 * are filled, the algorithm determines the blocks from the *evictable area* that should be freed from this sequence
 * based on the importance scores accumulated after each previous generation step in the pipeline. The least important
 * tokens according to this score are to be evicted. Only the tokens from the *evictable area* are evicted - the tokens
 * in the *start* and *recent* areas are never evicted, but throughout the eviction process the *recent* blocks naturally
 * move into the *evictable* area.
 *
 * Eviction only starts when at least one block *past* the *recent area* is completely filled, and the corresponding number
 * of blocks is selected to be evicted, so that the remaining blocks completely fit into the arena defined by the *start*,
 * *evictable* and *recent* areas. This effectively caps the cache usage for the sequence by the size of the arena (plus,
 * in general, one partially filled block past the recent area).
 *
 * Sizes of *start*, *evictable* and *recent* areas are configurable, but the *evictable* area size specifies the
 * _minimal_ size of the evictable area. When tokens overflow the eviction arena, the actual evictable area is
 * determined as the tokens between the fixed-size *start area* and the fixed-size *end area*, so at a given eviction step
 * there are in general more tokens considered for eviction than the specified *evictable* size.
 *
