At present there is an estimated maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season for these tours. The company does not wish to provide capacity in excess of the estimated maximum demand. The basic data are given below for the two types of available boats. The company will make an estimated seasonal profit of $4,000 for each boat of Type 1 and $7,000 for each boat of Type 2. How many boats of each type should the company use to maximize profit?

Explanation: The linear programming problem (illustrated in Figure 1) is: Maximize 4,000 x1 + 7,000 x2 Subject to 1,200 x1 + 2,000 x2 $\\le $ 6,000 25,000 x1 + 80,000 x2 $\\le $ 200,000 x1, x2 $\\ge $ 0; x1 x2 are integers. Constraints in the original problem formulation should be transformed so that all coefficients are integers. This is done to facilitate solution of the integer programming problem. No transformation is required in this problem. If there were a constraint such as (3/4)x1 + (6/4)x2 $\\le $ (48 / 10), both sides must be multiplied by 20 so that it becomes 15x1 + 30x2 $\\le $ 96. To simplify notation, divide the first constraint by 100 and the objective function and second constraint by 1000 and construct the initial tableau (Tableau 1). Tableau 1ciBASISV1V2V3V4bi0x3122010600x4258001200 The final tableau in the Simplex solution is: Tableau 2ciBASISV1V2V3V4bifi04x1100.1739 0.04351.7390.7397x201 0.05430.02611.9560.956Solution (x0)00 0.3155 0.008720.65 Since the solution is non integer, add cutting planes to reduce the feasible region until an integer solution is obtained. The following steps will be used to develop new cutting planes (or constraints). 1. Add a new column to the final Simplex tableau. This is the fi0 column in Tableau 2. For each bi value associated with a basic variable determine an fi0 value, where fi0 is a nonnegative fraction greater than or equal to zero but less than one, which when subtracted from a given noninteger will convert to an integer (e.g. 0.739 subtracted from 1.739 will convert it to an integer; 0.25 subtracted from 6.75 will convert it to an integer). 2. The largest fio value will determine the row of the tableau to be used in constructing a cutting plane. In the above tableau f20 = 0.956 designates the second row to be used for this purpose since 0.956 > 0.739 (i.e. f20 > f10).When ties occur, an arbitrary choice among tied rows is made. For each aaj coefficient in this row determine an fij value, just as fi0 was determined for bi. x1x2x3x4biRow 201 0.05430.02611.956f2j values000.94570.02610.956Integer value01 101 The f2j values give a new constraint 0x1 + 0x2 + 0.94.
